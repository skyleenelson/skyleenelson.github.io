      <description>The 1995-96 Chicago Bulls and 2015-16 Golden State Warriors are considered to be two of the greatest team’s in NBA history. Both teams had record breaking seasons as well as NBA All-Star players Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson.

      <description>Miles, Mason, and Marshall Plumlee were all top-ranked basketball recruits heading into college at Duke University. The brother’s spent four years on the Blue Devils roster, and in that time each have contributed to winning a national championship. The brothers’ success at Duke ultimately led each of them to reach the highest level of basketball playing in the NBA.
The Plumlee trio was an unforgettable time for Blue Devils basketball.</description>
